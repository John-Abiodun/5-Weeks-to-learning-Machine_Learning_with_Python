# Week 2 – Supervised Machine Learning

This week covers foundational supervised learning techniques, focusing on both regression and classification algorithms using scikit-learn.


Monday & Tuesday (Aug 4–5, 2025): Regression
- Introduction to Regression Analysis
- Simple & Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
  - R² (R-Squared)
- Case Study: Predicting House Prices

Wednesday & Thursday (Aug 6–7, 2025): Classification
- Introduction to Classification Analysis
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Decision Trees and Random Forest
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC
- Case Study: Email Spam Detection or Credit Risk Prediction

Friday (Aug 8, 2025): Review & Presentations


Key Learning Outcomes

- Understand the difference between regression and classification
- Train and evaluate supervised ML models using scikit-learn
- Interpret model performance using proper metrics
- Work with real-world datasets to apply regression and classification

Notes

- Datasets are provided within each day's folder or in the shared `data/` directory
- Notebook descriptions and problem statements are included at the top of each `.ipynb` file
- This week builds the foundation for Week 3 (Unsupervised Learning)
