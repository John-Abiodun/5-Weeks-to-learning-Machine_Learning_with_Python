# 5 Weeks to Learning Machine Learning

This repository documents my 5-week hands-on journey through Data Analytics and Machine Learning as part of a structured bootcamp. Each week includes curated class activities, case studies, and mini-projects using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

> The goal of this repo is to serve as a learning log.
